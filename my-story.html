                <p>I want to share how I found success in this terrible job market</p>

                <p>After being laid off twice since 2022 and having to sell my house, I know firsthand how brutal this job market is. I'm not alone - it's really difficult out there for so many people.</p>

                <p>Success in job hunting isn't about volume resume blasts. It's about conversations with real people who can connect you to real opportunities.</p>

                <p>The problem I faced was simple: I couldn't get enough conversations with the right people. In six weeks, I had just one interview. That interview came from a single comment I left on a post about a company hiring. The person replied the same day, we spoke the next day, and a week later I was talking to the hiring manager.</p>

                <p>Job seeking shouldn't be about hoping for a conversation - it should start with one.</p>

                <p>That's why I built Junior. It's an automated inbound personal marketing engine that helped me turn things around. It worked so well that I decided to start a company so you can have your own Junior.</p>

                <p>If you're struggling to start conversations with the right people, I encourage you to sign up for our Beta test.</p>

                <p>Have the right conversation, at the right time. Unlock new opportunities that can change your life. It changed mine.</p>
